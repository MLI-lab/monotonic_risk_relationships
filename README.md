# Monotonic Risk Relationships under Distribution Shifts for Regularized Risk Minimization

## Figures 2, 3, and 6

To generate Figure 2, run the notebook [`Simulation.ipynb`](https://github.com/MLI-lab/monotonic_risk_relationships_under_distribution_shifts_for_regularized_risk_minimization/blob/main/Simulation.ipynb).

To generate Figures 3 and 6, run the notebook [`Classification Theory.ipynb`](https://github.com/MLI-lab/monotonic_risk_relationships_under_distribution_shifts_for_regularized_risk_minimization/blob/main/Classification%20Theory.ipynb).

Dependencies are standard scientific computing packages, plus [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) for progressbars and [`cmasher`](https://cmasher.readthedocs.io/) for better colormaps. Both notebooks can be run in only a few minutes.
